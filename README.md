# Micromouse-simulator-2.0
micromouse stimulator stimulates  a Bot moving across a maze to solve it using modified flood fill algorithm .
there are many path finding algorithms are there but to work in an microcontroller where memory and computation power is limited , our best shot is flodd fill algorithm.
this simulator was develped  to check whether algorithm developed for solving a maze was right.

## installation.
install processing from https://processing.org/download/. install g4p gui builder in processing . And you are good to go.

## development
It is developed using processing and gui is made by using g4p gui buider. It uses modified flood fill algorithm to solve the maze. It would take multiple run figure out optimal path(not more than 3).
the maze is didvided into 256 cell ie 16*16 , each of them is 40*40 pixels size. Bot starts at leftmost bottom corner and objective is to reach center of the maze marked Zero.
Maze could be developed by user by clicking at the lines or grid or by dragging the mouse while clicked across your desired path.

### issues
* It currently does not have efficeint algorithm to come back to starting point.
* do not have the diagonal movement



 this is free and u can use it in any manner ðŸ¤˜âœŒðŸ‘Š
